# Welcome to My Basecamp 2

## Task
The goal of this project is to enhance the functionality of our Basecamp 1 app by introducing messaging features. Users can now post messages, reply to messages, and manage their messages efficiently. Additionally, the project includes the ability to post and manage attachments.

## Description
This web application is built using the Ruby on Rails framework. Users can perform various actions related to messages, including creating new messages, editing messages, replying to messages, and deleting messages and replies. The application also supports posting and deleting attachments. Users can view a list of messages, explore individual messages with their replies, and navigate seamlessly between different sections.

To address these requirements, we designed and implemented a robust database schema to store messages and replies. We created controllers to handle user actions and developed views to present relevant content. The application features user authentication using the Devise gem, ensuring that only authorized users can access and perform specific actions related to messages and projects.

- Remove an attachment: Click on edit on the project homepage and check the "Remove Attachment" checkbox.

Please note that certain actions, such as editing or deleting messages, may only be available to users with specific roles or permissions.
